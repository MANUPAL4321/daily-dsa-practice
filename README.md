# Daily DSA Practice

This repository contains my **daily coding practice** for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
I solve problems every day and upload solutions directly from IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📅 Weekly Goal
**Solve 30 problems every week**, focused on:

- ✔ Stack  
- ✔ Queue  
- ✔ Linked List  

(Week 1 target: 30 problems before 13th December)

## 📂 Repository Structure
I follow a clear folder structure for each week and each day:



## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Stack Operations  
- Queue Implementations  
- Linked List Problems  
- Two Pointers  
- Recursion  
- Searching & Sorting (coming weeks)  

## 🎯 Why This Repo?
- To stay consistent with daily coding  
- To improve DSA skills for interviews  
- To maintain clean and organized code  
- To track progress publicly on GitHub  

## 🚀 Tools Used
- **Java (JDK 17)**
